# A or An

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/roleupjobboard/a-or-an.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/roleupjobboard/a-or-an)

This is the Go implementation of the Javascript library https://github.com/EamonNerbonne/a-vs-an/.

# RoleUp job boards usage

I ported the library to Go to get the right indefinite article in front of the job titles. 
Job page descriptions use the package to write a correct English sentence. 
Fictive examples:
- Acme company is hiring **a** BSP engineer
- Acme company is hiring **an** NSA analyst
- Acme company is hiring **an** iOS developer
